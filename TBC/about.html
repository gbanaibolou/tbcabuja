	    <p><b>Trinity Baptist Church Abuja</b> has been designed to reflect and recapture gospel-centered worship. We see worship as an act of offering sacrifice and praise to God. This is our priority: to worship God according to how He commands. Central to our worship is the proclamation of the Word of God by way of biblical exposition. Trinity stands in the tradition of Reformation faith and practice.</p> <br>

	  	<h2>Our Vision</h2>
	  	<p>Our desire is to be a biblical, vibrant, living church where God's word is faithfully <b>preached</b> and <b>practiced</b>.</p> <br>

	  	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
	  	<p>We exist to promote the reverent worship of God, evangelize sinners, and minister to the saint's spiritual and material needs.</p> <br>    		
	  
  		<h2>Our Beliefs</h2>
  		<h4><b>We believe God calls us to . .</b></h4>
  		<ul>
  			<li>Engage in the local church by coming together to worship Him and grow in our understanding and application of His word.</li>
  			<li>Invest in one another’s lives through relationships, care, and support.</li>
  			<li>Serve with the gifts and resources God has provided to strengthen the church, meet needs in our community, and to reach out with gospel hope both near and far.</li>
  		</ul>

  		<h4><b>Our worship services express that we are ...</b></h4>
  		<ul>
  			<li><b>Reformed in our theology</b>. We trust wholly in the sovereign grace of God in and over all things.</li>
  			<li><b>Baptistic in our church polity</b>. Under Christ and his word, the congregation is the final authority in church governance with a Council of Elders who oversee and teach the people. We practice and teach believer’s baptism (by immersion).</li>
  		</ul>

  		<h4><b>We affirm shared beliefs ...</b></h4>
  		<ul>
  			<li>All the pastoral staff and elders embrace the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith.</li>
  			<li>Members are required to embrace the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith.</li>
  		</ul> <br>

	    <h2>Our History</h2>
		<p>We began to meet as a Church formally on the 9th of December 2018. When the missionary Pastor, Abutu Peter Joshua, came back from Zambia after his acceptance and ordination by the Elders of Kabwata Baptist Church, Lusaka Zambia. He began to assemble people in his living room every Lord’s Day evenings from the first week of May 2018 for Christian fellowship.</p>
		<p>This gathering, through the help of God, did grow to about ten adults, which form the core of the first persons of this ministry.</p>
		<p> The Church, still in its early days, has seen both trials of faith and numerous blessings of the LORD.</p>
